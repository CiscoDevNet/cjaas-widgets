# cjaas-widgets

This open source repository is a reference material for direct use or further development of Web Widgets.
These widgets had been designed to work with data, provided by Cisco CJaaS API and can be used in a stand alone web application as well as within Cisco Webex Contact Center.

Each widget is individually located in a corresponding folder. This repository provides a Sandbox environment to review, test and further enhance widgets to the user's individual need, as well as an easy build process in order to generate ready-to-use widget bundles. 

Widgets available:
